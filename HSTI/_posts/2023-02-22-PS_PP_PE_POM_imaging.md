The Hyperspectral Thermal Camera (HSTC) is sensitive to radiation of wavelengths between 8−16 μm corresponding to 625-1250 cm<sup>-1</sup>. Several types of plastics have absorption lines in this part of the electromagnetic spectrum. The types of plastic investigated in this post are Polypropalene (PP), Polyethylene (PE), Polystyrene (PS) and Polyoxymethylene (POM). Their absorption spectra have been measured with Attenuated Total Reflectance (ATR) spectroscopy and presented below:
