Two additional lenses was placed in front of the Fabry-Pérot to "colimate" the light in order to reduce the effects of spectral bending. A hyperspectral data cube of a 60 °C hotplate has been acquired both with and without compensating optics. SNV has been applied to the data cubes and a single layer of each are presented in Fig. 1.

Interferograms are extracted and presented in Fig. 2 showing the effect of spectral bending being reduced. The central interferogram is the mean of 40×40 pixels, while the "edge" interferogram is the mean of 20×20 pixels.

However, the image quality is also dramatically reduced as seen in Fig. 3 which show the same layers of the data cube as in Fig. 1, but only mean centered.
