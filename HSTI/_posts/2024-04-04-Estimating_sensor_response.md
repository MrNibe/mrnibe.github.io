### Using fast nonnegative least squares (FNNLS)
I have previously had some luck with with using fast nonnegative least squares (FNNLS) to estimate the sensor response based on empirical measurements. For this I need for formulate an $\mathbf{Ax} = \mathbf{b}$ problem for the solver. [It has previously been described how to set up this problem, so I will not go into much detail here]({% link HSTI/_posts/2023-10-25-Estimating_system_matrix.md %})_. Just know that the $\mathbf{A}$ matrix expresses the known (estimated from FTIR) net flux (incident minus emitted), $\mathbf{b}$ is the measured interferogram (without offset - we'll discuss that later), and $\mathbf{x}$ is the sensor response we need to solve for.  

$$
\begin{align} \label{eq:fpi_flux}
	\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{T_{SFPI}}\diamond(\mathbf{t_{samp}}\circ\mathbf{m_{BB}}(T_{BB}) + \mathbf{r_{samp}}\circ\mathbf{m_{env}}(T_{env})) + \mathbf{R_{SFPI}} \diamond \mathbf{m_{sens}}(T_{sens}) - \mathbf{m_{sens}}(T_{sens}) 
\end{align} 
$$

Here, $\mathbf{t_{samp}}$, and $\mathbf{r_{samp}}$ are FTIR measurements of the sample's transmittance and reflectance respectively. $\mathbf{T_{SFPI}}$ and $\mathbf{R_{SFPI}}$ are transmittance and reflectance estimates of the SFPI and $\mathbf{m_{subscript}}(T)$ are black body spectra at the temperature, $T$. The solution needs to be smoothness regularized, and the final system of equations for all measurements therefore becomes

$$
\begin{align} \label{eq:soe}
	\begin{bmatrix}
	\mathbf{A_{acetone}} \\
	\mathbf{A_{ammonia}}\\
	\vdots\\
	\mathbf{A_{toluene}}\\
	\gamma_{reg}\mathbf{M}\\
	\end{bmatrix}
	\mathbf{x}
	=
	\begin{bmatrix}
	\mathbf{b_{acetone}} \\
	\mathbf{b_{ammonia}}\\
	\vdots\\
	\mathbf{b_{toluene}}\\
	\mathbf{0}
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{align} 
$$

where $\gamma_{reg}$ is the regularization parameter, and $\mathbf{M}$ is the smoothness regularization matrix. The solution found using FNNLS is presented in Fig. 1.

### Finding my own gradient decent solution

But I want more control - in particular, I want to be able to account for the unknown offset, there is for every separate interferogram. But firstly, let's see if we can't get a similar solution to the FNNLS without the offset. The objective function is then formulated as follows

$$
\begin{align} \label{eq:arg_min}
  \arg \min_{\mathbf{x}} ||\mathbf{b} - \mathbf{Ax}||_2^2 + \gamma_{reg}||\mathbf{Mx}||_2^2 \qquad \textrm{s.t.} \quad \mathbf{x} \geq 0
\end{align} 
$$

Finding the gradient with respect to $\mathbf{x}$ yields:

$$
\begin{align} \label{eq:deriv_x}
  \nabla_\mathbf{x}\left[||\mathbf{b} - \mathbf{Ax}||_2^2 + \gamma_{reg}||\mathbf{Mx}||_2^2\right] = 2\left(\mathbf{A}^T\mathbf{Ax} - \mathbf{A}^T\mathbf{b} + \gamma_{reg}\mathbf{M}^T\mathbf{Mx}\right)
\end{align} 
$$

The gradient decent algorithm is defined as

$$
\begin{align} \label{eq:update_x}
  \mathbf{x} \leftarrow \mathbf{x} - 2\alpha \left(\mathbf{A}^T\mathbf{Ax} - \mathbf{A}^T\mathbf{b} + \gamma_{reg}\mathbf{M}^T\mathbf{Mx}\right), \quad \alpha = \frac{2}{||\mathbf{A}^T\mathbf{A}|| + \gamma_{reg}||\mathbf{M}^T\mathbf{M}||}
\end{align} 
$$

Where $\alpha$ is the maximum step size as determined by the Lipschitz constant. Implemented in python, this looks like 


```python
def Ax_minus_b_w_reg(A, x, b, M, gamma, itermax):
    AtA = A.T @ A
    Atb = A.T @ b
    MtM = gamma * (M.T @ M)
    U, S_A, Vh = np.linalg.svd(AtA, full_matrices=True)
    U, S_M, Vh = np.linalg.svd(MtM, full_matrices=True)
    stepsize = 5e1/(S_A[0] + gamma * S_M[0])
   
    cost_func = []    
    v = np.copy(x)
    for i in range(itermax):
        grad_v = AtA @ v - Atb + MtM @ v
        x_old = x
        x = np.maximum(0, v-stepsize*grad_v) 
        v = x + (i/(i+3)) * (x - x_old)
        cost_func.append(0.5 * np.linalg.norm(A @ x - b)**2)
    return x, cost_func
```


Running this 5000 times with $\gamma_{reg} = 50$ yields similar results to FNNLS as depicted in Fig. 2.

### Now let's add an offset

I want to solve for the offset separately, meaning everything else is held constant. The optimization problem then becomes

$$
\begin{align} \label{eq:arg_min_offset}
  \arg \min_{\psi}||\mathbf{b} - \mathbf{Ax} - \psi\mathbf{1}||_2^2  = \arg \min_{\psi}||\mathbf{c} - \psi\mathbf{1}||_2^2
\end{align} 
$$

where $\psi$ is a constant scalar offset and $\mathbf{1}$ is a vector of 1's with the same dimension as $\mathbf{b}$ (and $\mathbf{c}$ for that matter).

The objective function can be expanded yielding

$$
\begin{align} \label{eq:objective_psi}
  ||\mathbf{c} - \psi\mathbf{1}||_2^2 = \mathbf{c}^T\mathbf{c} - \psi\mathbf{c}^T\mathbf{1} - \psi \mathbf{1}^T\mathbf{c} + \psi^2\mathbf{1}^T\mathbf{1} = ||\mathbf{c}||_2^2 - 2\psi⟨\mathbf{c}|\mathbf{1}⟩ + \psi^2||\mathbf{1}||_2^2
\end{align} 
$$

which is achieved by utilizing that the matrix inner product $⟨\mathbf{A}\|\mathbf{B}⟩=\textrm{Tr}(\mathbf{A}^T\mathbf{B})$ and that the trace is transpose invariant.

We notice that this is really just a quadratic function in terms of $\psi$ as we can rewrite it as

$$
\begin{align} \label{eq:quadratic_psi}
   ||\mathbf{c}||_2^2 - 2\psi⟨\mathbf{c}|\mathbf{1}⟩ + \psi^2||\mathbf{1}||_2^2 = a_1 + a_2\psi + a_3\psi^2, \qquad a_1 = ||\mathbf{c}||_2^2, \quad a_2 =  - 2⟨\mathbf{c}|\mathbf{1}⟩, \quad a_3 = ||\mathbf{1}||_2^2 
\end{align} 
$$

$⟨\mathbf{c}\|\mathbf{1}⟩$ is really just the sum of $\mathbf{c}$ and $\|\|\mathbf{1}\|\|_2^2$ is just the number of elements in $\mathbf{c}$. We are interested in finding the value of $\psi$ which minimizes the objective function. It is not guaranteed that the function is exactly 0 anywhere, so instead of finding roots, we simply find the derivative with respect to $\psi$ and set it equal to zero. From this we find a closed form expression for $\psi$

$$
\begin{align} \label{eq:closed_psi}
   \psi = \frac{-a_2}{2a_3} = \frac{⟨\mathbf{c}|\mathbf{1}⟩}{||\mathbf{1}||_2^2}
\end{align} 
$$

which is simply just the mean of $\mathbf{c}$.
