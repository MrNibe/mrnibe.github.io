The performance of organic semiconductor devices is strongly affected by the interface energetics at the junctions between the constituent materials. A large group of organic semiconductors consists of rodlike small molecules that crystallize upon deposition with a molecular orientation dependent on the specifics of the molecule–molecule and molecule–substrate interactions. By means of Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM), this work studies naphthyl end-capped oligothiophene, 5,50-bis(naphth-2-yl)-2,20-bithiophene (NaT2), deposited on samples of pristine SiO<sub>2</sub> and samples of graphene-covered SiO<sub>2</sub>. The crystal molecular orientation of NaT2 is dependent on the substrate on which it is deposited. On SiO<sub>2</sub>, the NaT2 molecules are predominately upright standing, forming crystallites with distinct terrace heights of 2.0±0.1 nm. Measurements indicate formation of an initial wetting layer in the NaT2-SiO<sub>2</sub> system for the upright standing molecules. When deposited on graphene, the molecules additionally form fibrous structures with heights of 41 - 115 nm consisting of molecules lying down (face-on orientation). Using KPFM, a difference in the local contact potential difference (CPD) of upright standing NaT2 and face-on oriented structures on graphene is measured to be -0.16±0.04 V, indicating a work function difference between the two system configurations, which is confirmed through Density Functional Theory calculations.
