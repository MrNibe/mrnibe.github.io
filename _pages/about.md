I am a PhD student working on the development of a hyperspectral imaging system for the long-wave infrared (LWIR) regime. I have a Master of Science in Engineering from the University of Southern Denmark where I am also taking my PhD. In my research I mainly focus on theoretical formulations of the imaging system as well as data analysis.
